# Orange_color-detector
Using openCV image processing I created an orange colour detecting program.
here I am using the computer vision open CV to make a program which detects the orange color and displays it in a seperate frame.
It works as a colour classifier.
The range can be more fine tuned to predic the color more accurately.
